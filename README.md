# DYNAMIC-ARRAY
•	This code handles the "Dynamic Array" problem, managing n sequences with q interconnected operations—like a puzzle where each step influences the next. In main, it reads n and q from the first line, then parses q queries (each with type, x, y) using ltrim, rtrim, and split into a 2D vector. The dynamicArray function initializes n empty vectors for sequences and tracks lastAnswer (starting at 0); for each query, it computes the sequence index as (x XOR lastAnswer) % n. Type 1 appends y to that sequence; type 2 fetches the element at y % size, updates lastAnswer, and stores it in results. Finally, it outputs the results line-by-line to OUTPUT_PATH.
